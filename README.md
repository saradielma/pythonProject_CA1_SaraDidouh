# pythonProject_CA1_SaraDidouh

This Django project is about a web app that displays questions, the user can select any question on the main page (localhost/polls/) and, once selected, they can choose between different default answers. This process can be done as many times as the user wants. Once the question has been answered and the answer has been sent, the user will be directed to a third page that will show the statistics of the question that he has just answered (how many times each answer has been selected).

It also has an administrator view, from where questions and possible answers can be added. From this view you can control everything in a more graphic and understandable way for anyone who uses it, without having to know how to program.
